# ParvusGelu-MaximusKubeJS

A Minecraft script pack for friends and the public.

**DISCLAIMER:**
This script pack is for friends and released publicly to ensure access.
Be warned that the best attempt was made, but this is a hobby project.

**REQUIRED MODS:**
The required mods are included with this pack as it's a dev pack.
This means if you are extracting this in the instance folder of your Minecraft then it will add mod jars to your environment.

**WHY INCLUDE MODS?**
The reason I haven't simply listed the mods out is because I want to ensure the vitality of my scripts by including the mods versions that worked with them.
That way it will always work, and if you need to download this without the recommended mods then simply open the zip file, and delete the mods folder.

**REMEMBER:**
It is not the best way to do it, but it is a way to do it.

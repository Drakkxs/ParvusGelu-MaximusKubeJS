This script pack is for friends and released publicly to ensure access.
Be warned the best attempt was made but this is not meant for widespread use on some global scale.
This is a hobby, and issues will be solved with that in mind.

The required mods are included with this pack as it's a dev pack. 
This means if you are extracting this in the instance folder of your minecraft then it will add mod jars to your environment.

The reason I haven't simply listed the mods out is because I want to ensure the vitality of my scripts by including the mods versions that worked with them.
That way it will always work, and if you need to download this without the recommend mods then simply open the zip file, and delete the mods folder.

Always remember:
It is not the best way to do it, but it is a way to do it.
